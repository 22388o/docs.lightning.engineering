# Overview

This guide will focus on getting Lightning Terminal installed and operational \(getting LiT, for short ðŸ˜‰\). There will be some command line operations and configuration file edits involved, but nothing too complicated and no building from source.

We've organized this section with different instruction sets depending on your OS and whether you want to connect to an integrated/local or remote `lnd` instance. Each instruction set will include sections for users that are not running `lnd` yet, and for users that wish to upgrade an existing `lnd` to `litd`.

{% page-ref page="ubuntu-integrated.md" %}

{% page-ref page="linux-remote.md" %}

{% page-ref page="macos-integrated-mode.md" %}

{% page-ref page="macos-remote-mode.md" %}

{% page-ref page="windows-integrated-mode.md" %}

{% page-ref page="windows-remote-mode.md" %}

You should only need to follow one guide before moving on to the [Walkthrough](../walkthrough.md) section and onwards. If you notice any issues or discrepancies as you follow this guide, PLEASE let us know! We will be continually improving and expanding this Intermediate guide as the Lightning Terminal expands its functionality, so be sure to come back often!
