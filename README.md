# Welcome to the Builder's Guide to the LND Galaxy!

If the terms "payment channel" and "hash time-locked contract" are foreign to you, it might be best to start with our [**Conceptual Overview**](conceptual-overview/introduction.md) first.

If you're a web developer looking to integrate Lightning into your application, check out our [**Build Your First Lapp**](build-a-lapp/overview.md) guide.

If you want to run your own node, join the Lightning Pool, and take advantage of tools like Loop and Faraday, [**Get LiT**](intermediate-get-lit/readme.md)!

Finally, if you're running a professional service and want to leverage best practices when it comes to APIs, channel backups, key management, et al., we have you covered in [**Best Practices**](advanced-best-practices/overview.md).

Additional external resources include our [Developer Slack](https://lightning.engineering/slack.html), [Github organization](https://github.com/lightninglabs), API documentation for [`lnd`](https://api.lightning.community/), [`loop`](https://lightning.engineering/loopapi/), and [`pool`](https://lightning.engineering/poolapi/).
