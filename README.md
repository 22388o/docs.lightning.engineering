# Welcome to the Builder's Guide to the LND Galaxy!

Start here if the terms "payment channel" and "hash time-locked contract" are foreign to you.

Check this out if you're a web developer looking to integrate Lightning into your application.

Run your own node, join the Lightning Pool, and take advantage of tools like Loop and Faraday.

Finally, we have you covered if you're running a professional service and want to leverage best practices when it comes to APIs, channel backups, key management, et al.

If you're looking for inspiration, we've included a sampling of community projects for you to look to. We hope you add whatever you build to this page!
