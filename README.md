  This repository is designed as a home for those building on Lightning. We hope
  it provides everything you need to get started out of the box, and that if

# Welcome to the Builder's Guide to the LND Galaxy!

If the terms "payment channel" and "hash time-locked contract" are foreign to you, it might be best start with our **Conceptual Overview** first.

If you're a web developer looking to integrate Lightning into your application, check out our **Build Your First Lapp** guide.

If you want to run your own node, join the Lightning Pool and take advantage of tools like Loop and Faraday, **Get LiT**!

Finally, if you're running a professional service and want to leverage best practices when it comes to APIs, channel backups, key management, et al., we have you covered in **Best Practices**.
