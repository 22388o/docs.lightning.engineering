If you’d like to extend this example app to add more features, here are some ideas to explore:

* Use a hodl invoice to ensure that the payment isn’t settled until the upvote is completed on the backend successfully.
* Use keysend to make the payment instead of creating an invoice first.
* Add support for webln + Joule to avoid showing the payment request modal.
* Only notify the sender and receiver of paid invoices, instead of all connected browsers
* Prevent multiple upvotes being submitted for a single payment hash
