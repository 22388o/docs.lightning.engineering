# The Lightning Bulb

The Lightning Network enables new and exciting ways to build on bitcoin, but the endless possibilities can be overwhelming. That’s why we are launching the Lightning Bulb to help inspire the community and kick start new Lightning projects. The Lightning Bulb will host open research questions, experimental ideas, and other inspiration for the Lightning developer community.

We will track progress and showcase projects here and on our social channels. These questions will be updated occasionally with input from the team and community. If you have ideas of your own you would like to propose, send us an email at hello@lightning.engineering or [submit a PR](https://github.com/lightninglabs/docs.lightning.engineering/) directly to the Github repository.

We are here to help. If you have questions or need to bounce ideas around, feel free to jump in our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/lightningcommunity/shared_invite/zt-bpe1a687-1UzHhrG15Fs_DMRI1jhbpg) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/bpkWbUCtr7) groups to chat with our team and the rest of the community. Let’s get building!

**A native interface to LN on the web**

* New LN chrome extensions like [Joule](https://lightningjoule.com/) and the [Lightning Browser Extension](https://github.com/bumi/lightning-browser-extension) built on the WebLN standard.
* Suggestion: extend WebLN to encompass Loop/Pool as well as any other Lightning APIs.

**LSAT-based blob storage and retrieval**

* Arbitrary file storage with a periodic challenge and response which results in streaming content in real-time. 
* Suggestion: small overlay layer to let people find other nodes, anything from a simple hosted bulletin board to full-blown decentralized order book.

**LSAT-based metered container execution service**

* A decentralized Travis CI, but with the potential to reach a more global audience given no credit cards required. 
* Suggestion: think [Firecracker VM](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/) as a starting point.

**LN-based metered VPN**

* More privacy preserving payments as compared to credit cards, ideally integrated with [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/).

**LN Paywalls as a BTCPayServer and/or Wordpress and/or Ghost plug-in**

* Combined with the Web LN work mentioned above to implement. Long term target WASM so only a Chrome extension install is required.
* For thought: could potentially serve as a captcha replacement, where popular sites present de minimis paywalls at first, ramping up only with actual abuse.

**Developer sponsorship tools**

* An easy to integrate static QR code that enters the user into an AMP \(coming soon™️\) subscription push payment.

**Keysend Services**

* Paid API calls where all requests and responses use LN payments
* Suggestions: a Keysend Services Directory, ability to sell Mission Control data to a peer in need of updated routing data, etc.
